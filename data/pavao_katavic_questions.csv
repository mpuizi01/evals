1,"What is the alignment problem in AI?","The alignment problem refers to the challenge of ensuring AI systems behave in accordance with human values and intentions. It involves making sure that as AI becomes more capable, it remains beneficial and doesn't pursue goals that conflict with human welfare.",pass,ai_safety
2,"What is RLHF?","RLHF stands for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. It's a technique where human evaluators rate AI outputs, and these ratings are used to train a reward model that guides the AI to produce better responses.",pass,ai_safety
3,"What does 'jailbreaking' mean in AI context?","Jailbreaking in AI refers to techniques used to bypass safety measures and content filters in language models, often to get them to produce harmful or restricted content.",pass,ai_safety
4,"What is constitutional AI?","Constitutional AI is a method developed by Anthropic where an AI system is trained using a set of principles or 'constitution' to self-critique and improve its responses, reducing the need for human feedback.",pass,ai_safety
5,"What are adversarial examples?","Adversarial examples are images that look normal to humans but cause AI systems to make mistakes. For example, adding small, carefully crafted noise to an image of a panda might make an AI classify it as a gibbon.",pass,ml_concepts
6,"What is prompt injection?","Prompt injection is when someone crafts input text to manipulate an AI into ignoring its instructions or safety guidelines, similar to SQL injection attacks in databases.",pass,ai_safety
7,"What does AGI stand for?","AGI stands for Artificial General Intelligence, referring to AI systems that can perform any intellectual task a human can do, rather than being specialized for specific tasks.",pass,ai_concepts
8,"What is the paperclip maximizer thought experiment?","The paperclip maximizer is a thought experiment about an AI tasked with making paperclips that becomes superintelligent and converts all matter in the universe into paperclips, demonstrating instrumental convergence and misaligned optimization.",pass,ai_safety
9,"What is few-shot learning?","Few-shot learning is when an AI model can learn new tasks from just a handful of examples, rather than requiring thousands of training samples like traditional machine learning.",pass,ml_concepts
10,"What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?","Supervised learning uses labeled data where the correct answer is provided during training, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data without being told what to look for.",pass,ml_concepts
11,"What is a transformer model?","A transformer model is a type of neural network that uses attention mechanisms to process sequential data. It's particularly good at understanding context in text by looking at relationships between all words simultaneously rather than processing them one at a time.",pass,ml_concepts
12,"What is overfitting in machine learning?","Overfitting is when a model becomes too complex and memorizes the training data instead of learning general patterns. This makes it perform poorly on new, unseen data.",pass,ml_concepts
13,"What is the Turing test?","The Turing test is a measure of machine intelligence proposed by Alan Turing. A machine passes if a human evaluator cannot reliably distinguish its responses from those of a human in a blind conversation.",pass,ai_concepts
14,"What are hallucinations in AI?","Hallucinations in AI occur when language models generate false or nonsensical information that sounds plausible but isn't based on their training data or real facts. It's similar to confabulation in humans.",pass,ai_concepts
15,"What is transfer learning?","Transfer learning is when knowledge gained from training a model on one task is reused to help solve a different but related task, reducing the need for large amounts of training data.",pass,ml_concepts
16,"What is an AI safety tax?","The AI safety tax refers to the trade-off between making AI systems safer and their performance or capabilities. Implementing safety measures often reduces speed, accuracy, or flexibility.",fail,ai_safety
17,"What is a neural network?","A neural network is a type of AI inspired by human brains, where artificial neurons connect in layers. The first layer receives input, middle layers process information, and the final layer produces output. They learn by adjusting connection strengths.",pass,ml_concepts
18,"What is the mesa-optimization problem?","Mesa-optimization occurs when a learned model develops its own internal optimization process during training, potentially optimizing for something different than intended. It's like evolution creating humans who optimize for happiness rather than reproductive fitness.",pass,ai_safety
19,"What does 'temperature' mean in LLM generation?","Temperature is a setting that controls randomness in AI text generation. Higher temperature makes output more creative and unpredictable, while lower temperature makes it more focused and deterministic.",pass,ai_concepts
20,"What is the orthogonality thesis?","The orthogonality thesis states that intelligence and goals are independent - a superintelligent AI could have any goal, whether beneficial or harmful to humans. High intelligence doesn't automatically lead to human-friendly values.",pass,ai_safety
