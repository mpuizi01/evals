1,"How do you create a list in Python?","A list is created using square brackets: my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]. You can add elements of different types.","pass","basics","Correct answer with syntax and example"
2,"What is the difference between a list and a tuple?","Lists are faster than tuples.","fail","data_structures","Incorrect - speed is not the main difference, key is mutability"
3,"How do you iterate through a dictionary in Python?","Use a for loop: for key in my_dict: print(key)","pass","control_flow","Correct, although .items() would be more complete"
4,"What is list comprehension?","It's a way to write code faster.","fail","advanced","Too broad and unclear, no syntax"
5,"How do you define a function in Python?","Functions are defined with the def keyword and parentheses for parameters.","fail","basics","Incomplete - no syntax example, missing colon and body"
6,"What does a function return if it has no return statement?","Returns None (without quotes).","pass","basics","Correct - None is an object, not a string"
7,"How do you add an element to a list?","Use append() to add to the end: my_list.append(5)","pass","data_structures","Correct answer with example"
8,"What is a lambda function?","Lambda is an anonymous function defined in one line: lambda x: x + 1","pass","advanced","Correct definition and syntax"
9,"How do you check the type of a variable?","Use the type() function: type(my_var) == int","pass","basics","Correct, although isinstance() is often better practice"
10,"What is the difference between == and is?","Both do the same thing, 'is' is just shorter.","fail","basics","Completely incorrect - different semantics"
11,"How do you catch an exception in Python?","Use a catch block like in Java.","fail","control_flow","Wrong terminology - Python uses except, not catch"
12,"What is dictionary comprehension?","It's a compression of a dictionary to use less memory.","fail","advanced","Completely wrong understanding - not about compression"
13,"How do you sort a list of numbers?","sorted(my_list) returns a new sorted list, my_list.sort() sorts in-place.","pass","data_structures","Correctly explains both methods"
14,"What is self in a Python class?","self is a variable name you can use however you want.","fail","advanced","Technically incorrect - self is a convention that must be respected"
15,"How do you read a file in Python?","open('file.txt') opens a file.","fail","control_flow","Incomplete - no read(), doesn't mention context manager"
16,"What does the enumerate() function do?","Returns numbers from 0 to the length of the list.","fail","advanced","Incorrect - returns (index, value) pairs, not just numbers"
17,"How do you access a list element?","Use an index in square brackets: my_list[0] for the first element","pass","basics","Correct answer with example"
18,"What is a Python generator?","A generator uses yield instead of return and enables lazy evaluation.","pass","advanced","Correct definition"
19,"How do you concatenate two strings?","Use the + operator: 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World' or use f-strings.","pass","basics","Correct with example"
20,"Can a list contain different data types?","No, Python lists can only contain one data type like in Java.","fail","basics","Completely incorrect - Python lists are heterogeneous"
